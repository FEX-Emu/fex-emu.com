More changes all over this place this month.
- Implemented some new CPU extensions
  - RDRAND/RDSEED and 3DNow!
    - RDRAND only exposed if your host CPU supports the extension
    - 3DNow! implementation also including the Extended and Geode exclusive instructions
- Implemented a way for guest applications to use CPUID to see FEX hypervisor
  - Any additional options we want the guest to see can be passed through
- Preparation work for JIT code caching
  - Switching over to loading function pointers from our state options to make the JIT code PIC compliant
  - Adding robin_map which the code cache will use
  - Updating vixl to have finer grained cursor control for JIT relocations
- A new IR JSON format
  - This allows cleaner IR implementations and more consistent emitter functions
  - Allow emitter functions to have validation inside of them for strict validation
  - Automatic SSA argument type validation to remove invalid IR generation
    - Already found a bug in our x87 code generation
- Musl fixes
  - FEX-Emu can now both be compiled for Musl and run Musl compiled applications

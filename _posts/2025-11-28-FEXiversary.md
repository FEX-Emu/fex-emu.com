Hey everyone! In light of the recent product announcements using FEX, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate our anniversary! On this day seven years ago (28th Nov 2018), I landed the first commit in the prototype project that would eventually become FEX-Emu! I want to thank the people from Valve for being here from the start and allowing me to kickstart this project. They trusted me with the responsibility of designing and frameworking the project in a way that it can work long-term; not only for their use cases but also keeping it an open project that anyone can adapt for their own use cases.

Additionally I need to thank the great collaborators that have worked on the project over the years, because this project wouldn't be here without them as well! Myself alone wouldn't be enough to push us over the finish line, as it was a large collaborative effort to get us where FEX is today! That said, I also need to give a huge shoutout to the community that has grown over the years. Everyone's tireless effort at testing weird edge case applications and reporting bugs/performance/etc problems has buffed out a significant number of problems before even being "user-viable."

This is only the beginning of our journey; FEX is still maturing and there is still a ton more we need to grow. FEX has been a wild ride and it has been so great sharing this project with the world!

Keep gaming, gamers!

In the beginning, there were integers.

And robots wanted precise math, and so the x87 floating
point unit was created.

And robots wanted faster math, and so SSE was created to
replace x87, and it was good.

## Speeding up x87

Although x87 is slow and deprecated, it hasn't disappeared. 64-bit games will
use SSE or even AVX for floating point math, but older 32-bit binaries --
compiled decades ago -- are filled with x87.

FEX aims to support your entire game catalogue. Last release, [we added AVX]({{site.baseurl}}/FEX-2407/) to
support the newest games. This release, we've circled back to the oldest. Old
games ought to run well on new hardware, but if they use x87, performance can
nosedive. Why? Two x87 quirks: 80-bit precision and the stack.

Floating point numbers are typically 32-bits or 64-bits. 32-bit is
faster, while 64-bit enhances precision for numerical computing. Our
target Arm hardware supports both 32-bit and 64-bit, but
x87 adds an unfortunate third mode: 80-bit. Ostensibly, the extra bits of
precision in intermediate calculations minimizes the accumulated error of
the final result.

Is that necessary? Careful code can mitigate rounding error without the massive
80-bit hammer, thanks to techniques like the [Kahan summation
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm). New
code doesn't miss the 80-bit hardware.

Sadly, the FEX team can't afford a time machine. They're not cheap anymore.
We'll see what happens with Moore's Law eighteen months ago. So we can't teach
game developers in 2005 how to make do with 64-bit floats. All we can do is
slowly emulate 80-bit floats in software, or substitute 64-bit and the game
won't notice.

The second problem with x87 is more obscure. In a typical instruction set, each
instruction specifies which registers it accesses. By contrast, x87 arranges
registers in a *stack*. Instead of a destination register, x87 instructions
push to the stack.  Instead of source registers, sources are indexed relative
to the top of the stack. Unlike 80-bit floats, stack machines are alive and
well for virtual machines. Like 80-bit floats, they complicate
emulation.

Arm instructions specify their registers directly, but we don't know which
registers an x87 instruction will use without knowing the stack top.
Previously, FEX worked around this mismatch by keeping the emulated x87 stack
in memory instead of registers.  Arm can indirectly index memory, so this
works. However, it's slow. Because Arm is a RISC architecture, this approach
requires multiple load/store instructions for every x87 arithmetic operation.

We can do better.

Instead of single instructions, we can translate entire x87 code blocks.  That
gives us the full context of each instruction. In "good" conditions, that lets
us statically determine the stack layout, so we can translate stack access to
real Arm floating point registers.  The stack loads and stores disappear the
our generated code.

There's another trick we can play. Sometimes games will copy 80-bit floats
without performing any calculations. Translating these copies na√Øvely is slow
due to 80-bit emulation overhead.  However, we can analyze multiple
instructions together to detect 80-bit copies and translate to efficient Arm
code.

These optimizations combine to a surprisingly large speed-up. To illustrate: a
hot block in [Psychonauts](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830/Psychonauts/) swizzles a 4x4 matrix. That's light on arithmetic but
heavy on x87 overhead. These optimization reduce the translated code from 2340
to 165 instructions. That's a **93%** improvement!

Big thanks to [Paulo](https://www.igalia.com/team/pmatos) for taming x87, available in
this month's FEX release.

title: FEX 2102 Released!
---

This is our [second tagged release](https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/releases/tag/FEX-2102), and it comes with several improvements and fixes. 

## Compatibility
- Unaligned cmpxchg & cmpxchg8b on ARMv8.1+
- Mutliblock now gracefully handles unsupported / invalid instructions. This makes it safe to always enable multi block
- Several fixes for 32-bit binaries: branch handling, signal return, memory allocation, ioctl32 for x86-64 host
- Improved BRK handling

## Perfomance
- Much reduced stuttering during JIT compilation. The JIT optimizer is now over 3x as fast.
- Per-thread IR Caching with cached RA, for faster recovery from code cache resets

## Usability
- Defaults now to jit, multiblock, 5000 instructions. 
- CPUID returns fex version

## Misc
- Cleaned up IR printing, extended asm tests to test IR dumping & IR printing
- Integrated gcc target tests to our CI
- Removed many warnings

This is our [firth tagged release](https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/releases/tag/FEX-2105), and it comes with loads of compatibility fixes, and performance improvements.

Major new features include ioctl32 marshaling, which allows FEX to run 32-bit OpenGL applications without a modified kernel, for supported drivers, as well as offline AOTIR which makes it possible to translate applications and libraries ahead of time to reduce loading times.

## Compatibility & Bug Fixes
- New, simpler ELF Loader
- ioctl32 marshaling for several device drivers
- Handle more cases of an application pinging self
- binfmt_misc fixes to support AppImage
- Several system call fixes (eventfd, eventfd2, openat, creat, trucnate, clock_nanosleep, pselect6, sendmsg, recvmsg)
- Signal fixes
- Better handling of `/proc/self/`, `/proc/pid-self/`
- Implements support for CLFLUSH

## Performance
- Faster AOTIR file loading
- AOTIR offline generation
- Switch to xxhash from fasthash
- IR structure optimizations
- Adds Long Divide removal pass
- Zero-cost asserts

## Misc
- Fixes host thread stacks ending up in lower 32-bit VA
- Remove reliance on librt and libnuma
- Default hidden visibility and strip symbols
- FEX now uses jemalloc
